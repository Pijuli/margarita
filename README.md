## Working on Margarita as a project dependency

More often than not we'd want to develop a "parent" project (such as Bonasera
or Dry Martini) while adding changes to Magarita.

The best way to do so is by installing Margarita as a local dependency.
Check out the instructions in [Local Installation](LOCAL_INSTALLATION.md).
