## Build Setup

```bash
# storybook with hot reload at localhost:6006
$ npm run docker:start

# run tests with watch mode enabled
$ npm run docker:test
```

Or, you can simply start all together with:

```bash
$ docker-compose up
```

## Local development within other projects

More of than not we'd want to develop a "parent" project (such as Bonasera
or Dry Martini) will being able to pull up new changes in Magarita.

The best way to do so is by installing Margarita as a local dependency.
Check out the instructions in [Local Installation](LOCAL_INSTALLATION.md)
