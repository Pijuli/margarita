# Margarita

Margarita is the UI Library from Holaluz.


## About Margarita

* Built on top of [@vue/cli](https://cli.vuejs.org/).
* Uses [Storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook) to develop, showcase, and test each component.
* Unit testing based on [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [vue-testing-library](https://github.com/dfcook/vue-testing-library).


## Installation

Clone the repo and install node dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```


## Useful commands

```bash
# run storybook
$ npm start

# run unit tests
$ npm test

# run unit tests with watch mode enabled
$ npm run test:watch
```

## How can I use Margarita as a dependency in a local project?

More often than not we'd want to develop a "parent" project (such as Bonasera or Dry Martini) while tweaking Magarita.

The best way to do so is by installing Margarita as a local dependency. Check out the instructions in [Local Installation](LOCAL_INSTALLATION.md).
